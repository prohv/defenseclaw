# the structured JSON event to stdin and reads the response from stdout.
#
# Forwards W3C trace context (traceparent / tracestate) when the agent
# has exported it via DEFENSECLAW_TRACEPARENT or OTEL_TRACEPARENT, so
# the hook span links back to the agent's parent span. See
# codex-hook.sh for the validation contract.

# Anthropic's Claude Code hook protocol — like Codex's — is strictly
# EITHER structured JSON on stdout with exit 0 (Claude parses the
# permissionDecision/decision from the JSON) OR exit 2 with the reason
# on stderr. Doing BOTH is a protocol violation: depending on Claude
# version, either the exit code wins (and the rich JSON reason is
# silently replaced with a generic "Hook exited with code 2" surface),
# or stdout wins inconsistently. This is the same shape bug we hit on
# codex-hook.sh where Codex explicitly logged
# "exited with code 2 but did not write a blocking reason to stderr"
# and then FAILED OPEN. Even where Claude Code currently still blocks
# on the exit code, mixing the protocols means the operator-facing
# reason ("matched: SEC-PRIVKEY:Private key") is at risk of being
# dropped between Claude versions.
#
# Resolution: when the gateway gave us structured claude_code_output
# (every block path in claude_code_hook.go does), trust it and exit 0.
# Fall back to exit-2-plus-stderr only when no structured output is
# present.
