# DefenseClaw Codex hook — forwards the full hook event payload to the
# DefenseClaw gateway's /api/v1/codex/hook endpoint. Codex pipes the
# structured JSON event to stdin and reads the response from stdout.
#
# W3C trace propagation: if the agent has already exported
# DEFENSECLAW_TRACEPARENT / OTEL_TRACEPARENT (etc.), the validated
# values are sent to the gateway as traceparent / tracestate headers
# so the hook span links back to the agent's parent span. Validation
# happens in _hardening.sh — a malformed value is silently dropped
# (the hook still posts to the gateway, it just starts a new root
# span).
