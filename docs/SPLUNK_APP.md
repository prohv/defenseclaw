# DefenseClaw Splunk App

The bundled local Splunk workflow installs a Splunk app named
`DefenseClaw Local Mode` automatically.

The app gives users a purpose-built investigation surface for `DefenseClaw` and
`OpenClaw` activity. It is not a general Splunk deployment guide, and it is
not a replacement for direct Splunk Observability Cloud setup. It is a local,
single-instance investigation surface for development, testing, and security
workflow validation.

For an existing remote Splunk Enterprise deployment, use
`defenseclaw setup splunk --enterprise` instead. That path forwards audit
events to an existing HEC endpoint and does not install this local Splunk app.

> **Multi-connector indexing.** A single gateway can serve several hook
> connectors at once. Enterprise HEC consumers should index the connector
> dimension so events can be sliced per connector: the top-level `connector`
> field (first-class on every audit row) and `structured.connector` on hook
> rows (`action="connector-hook"`). Example:
> `index=<your-index> action="connector-hook" structured.connector="codex"`.
> See `docs/OBSERVABILITY-CONTRACT.md` → Connector dimension fields.

For the legal and local-scope guardrails for this workflow, see
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Access

When you run:

```bash
defenseclaw setup splunk --logs --accept-splunk-license --non-interactive
```

`DefenseClaw` starts the bundled local Splunk runtime and installs the local
Splunk app automatically.

The setup creates a restricted Splunk user:

- username: `defenseclaw_local_user`
- default app: `defenseclaw_local_mode`
- default index scope: `defenseclaw_local`

The setup command prints the local Splunk URL and credentials after bootstrap.

## What Data The App Uses

The app is built on a narrow local signal model. The current shipped signal
families are:

- `defenseclaw:json`
  - DefenseClaw audit and policy decision events
- `openclaw:gateway:json`
  - structured OpenClaw gateway and runtime evidence
- `openclaw:diagnostics:json`
  - queue, session, retry, and runtime-diagnostics events
- `otel:metric`
  - event-indexed usage, cost, duration, and queue-pressure metrics
- `otel:trace`
  - trace spans for usage and run/session correlation

The default local search contract is:

- index: `defenseclaw_local`
- source: `defenseclaw`
- sourcetype: `defenseclaw:json`
- local HEC endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8088/services/collector/event`

The app layers macros, eventtypes, saved searches, and dashboards on top of
those signal families.

## What The App Is For

The current app is optimized for four local questions:

- what did `DefenseClaw` allow, deny, block, quarantine, or enforce?
- which runs or sessions look risky and need review?
- what runtime, queue, or diagnostics evidence explains that risk?
- what should the operator investigate next in raw Splunk search?

The app intentionally stops at:

- detect
- explain
- investigate
- recommend the next useful check

It does not imply automated response, multi-instance deployment, or unsupported
enrichment domains.

## App Navigation

The app ships with four navigation groups.

### Overview

`Overview` is the narrow security-operations command center.

It shows:

- risk-state distribution
- highest-priority investigations
- packaged detection activity
- direct filters for `run_id` and `session_id`

This is the best landing page for deciding what to inspect first.

### Investigate

#### Audit And Security

Primary page for `DefenseClaw` audit and control outcomes.

Use it to answer:

- what actions happened recently
- which actions were deny, block, quarantine, or enforce
- which actors and targets were involved
- which high-severity audit outcomes are present

#### Runs And Sessions

Primary run/session investigation workbench.

Use it to:

- pick a candidate investigation
- review the current risk state and risk reason
- inspect correlated policy, runtime, diagnostics, usage, and trace evidence
- follow the recommended next pivots

This is the main investigation surface in the current app.

#### Queue And Runtime Health

Diagnostics-driven runtime health page.

Use it to inspect:

- active queue lanes
- stuck sessions
- retry storms
- message-processing failures
- wait behavior and queue pressure

### Observe

#### Gateway Logs

Structured gateway-log troubleshooting page backed by
`openclaw:gateway:json`.

Use it to inspect:

- log volume by level
- noisy subsystems
- repeated error signatures
- recent gateway errors

#### Model Usage And Cost

Structured metrics and traces page.

Use it to inspect:

- token activity
- local cost estimates
- long-duration or slow runs
- queue pressure from metrics
- trace spans by run and session

This page is for local investigation, not billing-authoritative reporting.

### Demo Dashboards

These pages provide Splunk-local equivalents for the demo Grafana/Loki
dashboards. They use the same local index, `defenseclaw_local`, and the same
event-indexed signal families listed above. They are designed for local demos
where Splunk should be the visible dashboard surface.

#### Executive Agent Watch Overview

High-impact landing page for local Splunk demos of Agent Watch.

Use it to inspect:

- total observed agent sessions
- active connectors
- discovery signal volume
- block/deny outcomes and human-review signals
- highest-attention sessions by run/session/trace identifiers
- policy and finding heatmaps

This page is intended to start demos with an executive story before drilling
into the detailed AI Discovery Inventory, Connector Activity, Policy Decisions,
and Findings/HITL dashboards.

#### Agent Tokenomics Overview

Executive view of O11y / OTel GenAI token telemetry for agent sessions.

Use it to inspect:

- total token activity by agent, connector, model, and session
- input, output, cached, reasoning, and tool-token mix
- top token-driving models, tools, and targets
- optimization candidates such as tool-heavy sessions, high reasoning-token use,
  low cache leverage, or unusually large output expansion

This page uses tokens as a cost proxy. It is not billing-authoritative and does
not use confidential customer-specific model pricing.

#### AI Discovery Inventory

Local view of AI discovery and shadow-agent signals.

Use it to inspect:

- active, new, changed, and gone AI signals
- signal category, vendor, product, and detector breakdowns
- recent discovery events and per-signal evidence

#### Connector Activity

Connector-level activity and verdict view.

Use it to inspect:

- active connectors in the selected time range
- connector event volume
- blocks, confirms, tools, targets, and recent connector events

#### Policy Decisions

Policy, verdict, egress, and block-list view.

Use it to inspect:

- allow, block, deny, and confirm activity
- top policies or rules firing
- blocked targets and recent policy-decision evidence

#### Findings And HITL

Rule finding and human-in-the-loop approval view.

Use it to inspect:

- findings by severity and rule
- critical or high-severity findings
- approval requests, approvals, denials, and recent HITL events

### Operate

#### Alerts And Saved Searches

Packaged detection and saved-search page.

The current shipped detection pack includes:

- repeated deny activity
- dangerous command or tool denied
- policy bypass or retry after denial
- stuck or retry-storm session
- runtime error burst around a risky run
- high-cost or long-duration risky run

These saved searches are disabled by default. The page explains what each one
does and what signal families it depends on.

#### Search And Drilldown

Raw search pivot page.

Use it to:

- scope by `run_id`
- scope by `session_id`
- narrow by pivot family such as `policy`, `runtime`, `diagnostics`, `usage`,
  or `trace`
- inspect the underlying evidence as raw searchable records

This is the bridge between dashboards and direct SPL.

## Investigation Model

The current app uses a seeded local investigation model built around:

- `run_id`
- `session_id`
- `session_key`
- `event_domain`
- `event_type`
- `action`
- `status`
- `severity`
- `actor`
- `target`
- `request_id`
- `trace_id`

The normalized evidence domains are:

- `policy`
- `runtime`
- `operations`
- `usage`
- `trace`

The current risk states are:

- `observed`
- `needs_review`
- `risky`
- `critical`

The command center and workbench are driven from the `dcso_*` support layer
that ships with the app bundle.

## Useful Searches

See what signal families are present:

```spl
index=defenseclaw_local
| stats count by sourcetype
| sort - count
```

See recent DefenseClaw audit activity:

```spl
index=defenseclaw_local source=defenseclaw sourcetype="defenseclaw:json"
| spath
| table timestamp action severity actor target details component status
| sort - timestamp
| head 20
```

See seeded investigation candidates:

```spl

```

See investigation evidence for a specific run or session:

```spl
`dcso_investigation_events("*","<session_id>")`
| table timestamp event_domain event_type component action status severity actor target message
| sort - timestamp
```

## Current Boundaries

This app is intentionally scoped.

- It is local-only and single-instance.
- It is optimized for `DefenseClaw` and `OpenClaw` investigation workflows.
- It does not promise a supported upgrade or migration path.
- It does not guarantee every Splunk Enterprise capability in every license
  mode.
- It does not replace a direct Splunk O11y deployment.
- It does not provide automated response or broad third-party enrichment.
