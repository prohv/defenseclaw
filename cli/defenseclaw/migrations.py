"""Version-specific migrations for DefenseClaw upgrades.

Each migration is keyed to the target version it ships with. During upgrade,
all migrations between the old version and the new version are applied in
order via ``run_migrations``.

Design contract for every migration:

* **Idempotent** — safe to re-run on an already-migrated install.
* **Atomic** — mutations write to a temp file and rename, never partial
  state on a crash.
* **Fail-safe** — a failure in one step is logged and the migration
  continues; the upgrade itself never aborts due to a migration error,
  because a half-upgraded install with a half-applied migration is
  worse than an upgraded install with stale residue we can clean up
  later via ``defenseclaw doctor --fix``.
* **No-touch** — operators do nothing; the migration runs automatically
  during ``defenseclaw upgrade``.

# Migration: 0.4.0 — Connector architecture v3 (PR #194)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# PR #194 lands the connector v3 wave. The breaking-for-existing-users
# pieces this migration addresses, in order:
#
#   1. **DEFENSECLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN bootstrap (S0.2)** — pre-v3 sidecars
#      fail-opened on missing token (loopback-allow). The new sidecar
#      fail-CLOSES on empty token, so any 0.3.x install that skipped
#      ``defenseclaw setup rotate-token`` would lock itself out of
#      /api/v1/inspect/* and the connector hook endpoints. We
#      synthesise a 32-byte CSPRNG hex token and atomically write it
#      to ``<data_dir>/.env`` with mode 0o600. The legacy
#      ``OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`` name is renamed if encountered so an
#      operator who hand-edited the .env keeps their value.
#
#   2. **File perms tighten** — ``.env``, ``device.key`` and any
#      ``*_backup.json`` left behind by intermediate dev builds are
#      ``chmod 0o600`` (S0.11/S0.15/H4/M3 require credentials-bearing
#      files to be operator-only).
#
#   3. **Legacy Codex env override files (S8.1 / F31)** — older
#      releases wrote ``codex_env.sh`` / ``codex.env`` under
#      ``data_dir`` that exported a global ``OPENAI_BASE_URL``. That
#      bled into non-Codex OpenAI SDK clients on the same box. The
#      new connector patches ``~/.codex/config.toml`` instead, scoped
#      to Codex. We delete the legacy files here so an upgrade leaves
#      the operator's host pristine, regardless of whether they ever
#      sourced the file from their shell rc.
#
#   4. **OTel claw.mode enum normalisation (S3.1 / F9)** — the
#      ``defenseclaw.claw.mode`` enum used to include ``nemoclaw`` and
#      ``opencode`` (forward-looking placeholders that never shipped a
#      Connector.Name() value). After PR #194 those values fail
#      schema validation in resource.schema.json. If ``config.yaml``
#      has either pinned, we coerce them to the closest live name
#      (``openclaw`` / ``codex``) so telemetry doesn't silently drop.
#
#   5. **Active-connector state seed** — pre-v3 had no
#      ``active_connector.json``. The sidecar's connector-handoff
#      logic (teardownPreviousConnector before Setup of the new one)
#      reads this file at boot to detect a switch. For an OpenClaw-
#      only install we seed it to "openclaw" so the very first
#      sidecar boot post-upgrade does NOT think the user has just
#      switched away from a phantom prior connector.
#
# This migration is intentionally permissive on errors: an individual
# step may fail (read-only filesystem, missing parent dir, custom
# DEFENSECLAW_HOME the operator forgot to migrate to the new path) but
# the upgrade itself MUST NOT abort. Each step logs a click warning
# and the migration moves on.

# Legacy Codex env override files retired in S8.1 / F31 and finally
# the surrounding proxy surface was removed in PR #265. We still scrub
# these files on upgrade because they may exist on disk for users
# coming from a release that did write them.

    """Surface ``guardrail.hook_fail_mode`` in pre-existing config.yaml.

    Pre-v3 installs had no concept of a hook fail mode — every hook
    was hardcoded to fail-closed on any gateway error, which gave
    operators a strictly-bad UX whenever the gateway was down. The v3
    wave introduces a dedicated config field; the runtime default is
    ``"open"`` (set in defaultsFor() and EffectiveHookFailMode), but
    we also write the explicit value to YAML on upgrade so:

    1. Operators inspecting ~/.defenseclaw/config.yaml after upgrade
       SEE the new field and discover the knob exists. A field that
       only lives in defaults is invisible — operators reach for
       ``defenseclaw guardrail fail-mode`` only when they know it's
       a thing.
    2. The on-disk state is self-describing — no surprise behavior
       change if a future release changes the runtime default.

    Skipped silently when the operator has already set a value (any
    value — we never overwrite an explicit choice, even one we
    consider unsafe).

    Comment-preservation contract: the previous implementation
    round-tripped the file through ``yaml.safe_load`` +
    ``yaml.dump``, which silently stripped every comment, blank
    line, and scalar quoting choice the operator had curated. That
    was unacceptable in a no-touch migration. This implementation is
    surgical: it inserts the new key right after the ``guardrail:``
    header line, mirroring the indentation of the next non-blank
    body line so the result drops cleanly into a hand-formatted
    file. Everything else under ``guardrail:`` (comments, alphabetic
    or grouped key ordering, embedded blanks) survives byte-for-byte.

    migration that we promise leaves the operator's curation intact.

    Algorithm:

      1. Read the file into memory as a list of raw lines (with line
         endings preserved).
      2. Walk every line. If it matches ``KEY=VALUE`` (the same
         permissive grammar ``_parse_dotenv`` accepts) AND its key is

         rewrite it as ``KEY=NEW_VALUE`` (preserving the trailing
         newline style of the original line) and mark the key as
         consumed. Otherwise keep the line verbatim.
      3. For any key in ``updates`` that wasn't seen during the walk,
         append ``KEY=VALUE`` at the end.
      4. Atomically write the result with mode ``0o600``.

    The function is idempotent and safe to re-run on an already-
    patched file (no-op when the desired KEY=VALUE pairs already
    match the file). Returns ``True`` on a successful write or no-op,
    ``False`` on a write failure (after logging via ``click.echo``).

# Background: ≤0.3.x installers wrote the OPA policy bundle directly under
# ``<data_dir>/policies/`` (flat layout). 0.4.x switched to the canonical
# nested layout under ``<data_dir>/policies/rego/``. The upgrade path
# never deleted the flat-layout files, so operators ended up with BOTH
# copies on disk:
#
#   <data_dir>/policies/guardrail.rego          ← stale flat copy (March '26)
#   <data_dir>/policies/data.json               ← stale flat copy
#   <data_dir>/policies/rego/guardrail.rego     ← canonical (with HILT logic)
#   <data_dir>/policies/rego/data.json          ← canonical (with HILT data)
#
# The Go loader's ``resolveRegoDir`` (internal/policy/engine.go) used to
# prefer the parent layout first, so it compiled the OLD modules. The
# stale ``guardrail.rego`` predates the HILT confirm branch, so HIGH
# severity prompt-stage findings always returned ``alert`` — never

# canonical 0.4.x bundle puts every one of these under ``policies/rego/``,
# so a flat-layout copy is, by definition, residue. We leave any other
# flat .rego files alone — operators sometimes drop hand-rolled custom
# rules into ``policies/`` and the migration must never destroy operator

    Why this is safe:

    1. Only runs when the canonical nested layout is present at
       ``<data_dir>/policies/rego/``. If the nested directory is missing
       (operator deleted it, or stayed on the flat layout deliberately),
       we do nothing — preserving the operator's chosen layout.

    2. Only deletes files we shipped ourselves. Any *.rego file at the
       flat path that is NOT in ``_LEGACY_FLAT_REGO_FILENAMES`` is left
       alone so a hand-curated custom rule never disappears mid-upgrade.

    3. Atomic on a per-file basis: each ``os.remove`` either succeeds or
       leaves the file in place; we never half-delete a file. A failure
       to remove one file does not abort the migration.

    4. Idempotent: re-running on a clean install (no flat residue) is a
       no-op.

    The migration also retires ``<data_dir>/policies/data.json`` when a
    canonical ``<data_dir>/policies/rego/data.json`` exists. The flat
    data.json no longer feeds the loader after the engine fix, but it
    is the single most common source of confusion ("which data.json
    does the gateway read?") and the upgrade is the right time to

# Migration: 0.5.0 — sub-step: strip legacy guardrail.*_enforcement_enabled
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 0.5.0 also retires the LLM proxy data path for Codex and Claude
# Code. Pre-0.5.0 guardrail config exposed two boolean fields that
# selected between the (now-removed) LLM proxy data path and the
# hook-only data path for those connectors:
#
#   guardrail.codex_enforcement_enabled: bool
#   guardrail.claudecode_enforcement_enabled: bool
#
# Both fields are gone from the schema. The only supported enforcement
# surface for those connectors is now the agent's native hook bus
# (PreToolUse / UserPromptSubmit / PostToolUse). Enforcement vs
# observation is selected via the existing ``guardrail.mode`` field —
# ``action`` causes the PreToolUse hook to return a deny verdict on
# policy hits, ``observe`` records only.
#
# Pre-0.5.0 config.yaml files on disk carry the legacy fields. The Go
# loader (which uses viper's UnmarshalExact) and the Python config
# loader (Pydantic with strict=False) both quietly ignore unknown
# keys today, so leaving them in place would not break boot. But:
#
#   * The TUI's "configedit" panel would surface stale fields the
#     operator can no longer edit usefully.
#   * ``defenseclaw doctor`` may complain about config drift.
#   * Operators reading config.yaml would have no way of knowing
#     whether the fields still matter; the file is the source of
#     truth for "what is this gateway doing" and dead fields make
#     that diagnostic noisy.
#
# The cleanup is byte-level (no YAML round-trip) so operator
# comments, blank lines, and key ordering inside the ``guardrail:``
# block are preserved exactly. The substitution is anchored to the
# guardrail block — a stray top-level ``codex_enforcement_enabled``
# elsewhere in config.yaml is intentionally NOT touched.

# Legacy keys to strip from the ``guardrail:`` block. The two
# enforcement booleans are mutually independent — an operator who
# explicitly opted into one but not the other will have only one key
# on disk; the migration handles either combination.

    matching keys present) is a no-op. Failures on read or write are

    keys in place is strictly less bad than aborting the upgrade.

    Comment-preservation contract: each match is deleted line-by-line

) -> int:
    """Run all applicable migrations up to ``to_version``.

    Source of truth for "what has run" is the per-host migration
    cursor at ``<data_dir>/.migration_state.json`` (see
    ``defenseclaw.migration_state`` for the schema). The
    ``from_version`` argument is now advisory — it only matters on
    the very first call after a host upgrades to a build that
    persists the cursor (the bootstrap path).

    Why we moved from "version-range" to "cursor-driven":

    * Version-range gates re-fired migrations whenever the author
      forgot to bump ``__version__`` before tagging a release —
      because ``current_version`` lagged the actual installed bits.
    * Partial failures (one migration in a batch raised) were
      indistinguishable from "never ran" — operators who re-ran the
      upgrade hit the failed step, but the SUCCESSFUL earlier ones
      ran AGAIN against state they had already mutated.
    * Operators restoring from backup snapshots quietly drifted out
      of sync because nothing on disk recorded which migrations had
      observably executed.

    The cursor's ``applied`` set fixes all three: each migration is
    only run once per host, full stop, and a partial-failure batch
    leaves successful entries marked and failed entries unmarked so
    re-running picks up exactly where it left off.

    Backward-compat preserved on purpose:

    * The ``from_version`` / ``to_version`` API is unchanged.
    * ``from_version == to_version`` (the same-version reapply
      escape hatch used by ``defenseclaw upgrade --version <same>``)
      still re-runs the migration at exactly ``to_version`` even
      when the cursor says applied. That's a documented operator
      tool for "I think this migration didn't take, please force
      it"; without it, the only recovery would be ``defenseclaw
      doctor migration-state --unmark X.Y.Z`` followed by upgrade,
      which is more friction than the historical UX warrants.

    ``data_dir`` defaults to ``$DEFENSECLAW_HOME`` or
    ``~/.defenseclaw`` when not supplied. The optional argument lets
    ``cmd_upgrade.py`` thread the loaded ``Config.data_dir`` through
    so that operators with a non-default ``DEFENSECLAW_HOME`` get
    their migration applied at the right path.

    Returns the number of migrations actually executed (excludes
    cursor-skipped ones). Failures don't increment the counter and
    don't leave a cursor entry — the next upgrade will retry them.
