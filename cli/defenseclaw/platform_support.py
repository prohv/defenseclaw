"""Per-OS connector support — the Python single source of truth.

DefenseClaw runs hook-only on Windows: agents invoke the native Go hook
entrypoint (``defenseclaw hook``) directly, and there is no Windows
guardrail-proxy lifecycle. The proxy/chat connectors (``openclaw`` and
``zeptoclaw``) therefore cannot run on Windows, so the TUI/CLI must not
offer or accept them there.

This module mirrors the Go ``connector.proxyConnectors`` set in
``internal/gateway/connector/platform_support.go``; a parity test pins the
two together so the lists cannot drift.

Filtering is a pure no-op on non-Windows hosts, so callers can apply it
unconditionally at presentation/validation points without changing
behavior on macOS or Linux.
