"""URL safety guards for registry adapters.

Registry sources are operator-provided URLs that DefenseClaw will fetch
on the operator's behalf — exactly the pattern that earns a finding in
:mod:`policies.guardrail` and the codebase rules. We refuse to fetch
anything that resolves to localhost, link-local, multicast, or
RFC1918/ULA private addresses by default. Operators that genuinely
need to ingest from a private host must opt in with ``--allow-private``;
the flag is plumbed all the way through the CLI surface so an
"oops, my URL was internal" mistake stays explicit.

This module is intentionally pure-Python and stdlib-only so it can be
unit-tested without network access — :func:`guard_url` performs DNS
resolution via :func:`socket.getaddrinfo`, but that lookup can be
mocked in tests by passing a custom ``resolver`` callback.
