"""defenseclaw uninstall / reset — clean removal and config wipe.

Removes DefenseClaw artifacts from the system in a predictable,
scriptable way so operators aren't left with a mess after evaluating
the tool. ``reset`` is the "lose my data" button — it wipes
``~/.defenseclaw`` but keeps the binaries and the agent framework's
plugin in place so ``defenseclaw quickstart`` can reinstall cleanly.

Connector polymorphism (S7.3)
-----------------------------
Removal of the agent framework's defenseclaw artifacts is delegated to
``defenseclaw-gateway connector teardown`` — the canonical sentinel that
each connector adapter implements (S7.2). This keeps the Python flow
honest: it never has to know how Codex / Claude Code / ZeptoClaw
configure themselves, which previously meant the OpenClaw teardown was
the only one that worked.

The Python side still owns OpenClaw-specific revert paths as a fallback
for very old gateway binaries (pre-S7.2) where the ``connector teardown``
subcommand is not available. The fallback only ever runs against
OpenClaw, never against the other adapters — calling
``restore_openclaw_config`` against a Codex install would corrupt it.
