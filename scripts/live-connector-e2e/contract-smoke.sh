# Layer A — Contract entrypoint smoke (deterministic, no LLM, no secrets,
# every OS). For one connector this script:
#
#   1. `defenseclaw setup <connector> --mode action` (installs the hook
#      entrypoint + wires the agent config + restarts the gateway).
#   2. Feeds every golden stdin payload under golden/<connector>/ into the
#      *installed* hook entrypoint:
#        - unix:    ~/.defenseclaw/hooks/<connector>-hook.sh
#        - windows: defenseclaw-gateway hook --connector <name> --event <ev>
#   3. Asserts the gateway received the event (fires) and that the entrypoint
#      shaped the verdict correctly (allow -> exit 0; block -> exit 2 or a
#      decision JSON carrying block/deny).
#   4. Tears down and asserts the agent config is restored clean.
#
# This proves the decode -> map -> respond contract through the real installed
# entrypoint on every OS, complementing the Go contract matrix (which proves
# the same chain at the handler level). The block payload reads /etc/shadow
# (rule PATH-ETC-SHADOW, CRITICAL) so it is denied deterministically without
# an LLM and is harmless if a regression ever lets it through.
#
# Usage: contract-smoke.sh <connector>
